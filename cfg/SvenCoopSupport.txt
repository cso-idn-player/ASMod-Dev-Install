//This file defines the memory addresses for functions retrieved from Sven Co-op. These are required in order for Sven Co-op support to function.
//All addresses must be updated when a new version of Sven Co-op is released.
//All addresses are in hexadecimal, relative to the base address of the library. At runtime the addresses are added to the base address to get the actual address.
