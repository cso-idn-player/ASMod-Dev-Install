This is the development installation for [AngelScript Mod Loader](https://github.com/SamVanheer/ASMod).

You will need [Metamod-P CMake](https://github.com/SamVanheer/Metamod-P-CMake) or the [Sven Co-op fork](https://github.com/SamVanheer/Metamod-P-CMake-svencoop) to run this plugin properly.

To install this plugin, clone it into `steamapps/common/<game>/<mod>/addons/ASMod`, where `<game>` is either `Half-Life` or `Sven Co-op`, and `<mod>` is the directory of the game or mod you are installing the plugin for.
